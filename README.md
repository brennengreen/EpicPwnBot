# EpicPwnBot

The purpose of this bot was to keep track of amount of jokes people made on the server.
If you thought that a message was funny you could give that person a "pwn point" these pwn points were tracked and people were
given cool rewards at the end of each month if they were in the top 3.

### Use:

Everything you need is in Bot.js! Sorry for the lack of dependency files I had to pull this out of the server and couldn't recover them!
